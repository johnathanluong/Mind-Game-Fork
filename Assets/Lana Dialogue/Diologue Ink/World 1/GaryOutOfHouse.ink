Oh, I almost forgot! You levelled up earlier, Hero! #speaker: Gary #portrait: Gary_neutral  #audio: GaryAudio
When you level up, you get points that you can allocate into your stats.
Press [TAB] and go into the [PARTY] menu to allocate them.
Don't worry about me though, I can allocate my points myself!
Also, I left some old stuff in that chest, go ahead and take whatever you want!
